I've read a lot great management and leadership books but this quote is getting printed out and stuck above my desk at work.

> _"Leadership is the activity of influencing people by providing purpose, direction and motivation to accomplish the mission and improve the organisation."_

If that doesn't get you going as a leader then nothing will!
