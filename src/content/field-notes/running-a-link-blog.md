[My approach to running a link blog](https://simonwillison.net/2024/Dec/22/link-blog/)

1. Simon has previously identified two two categories of low stakes, high value writing:
   1. Things he has learned
   2. Descriptions of his projects
2. He introduces a third category; things he has found.
3. Simon highlights a series of principles for this new category:
   1. "Always include the names of the people"
   2. "Try to add something extra" (pull out interesting snippets or link to other related material)
   3. Be "liberal with quotations"
   4. If the original author finds the post they should "feel good about it"
   5. "Prove that you've read it" (include detail)
   6. Share video, audio and screenshots, not just text

My goal is to reach the consistency of Simon's writing and turn my open browser tabs into something of value for myself and others.
