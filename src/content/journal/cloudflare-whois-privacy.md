Before setting up [my domain as my Bluesky handle](https://bsky.social/about/blog/4-28-2023-domain-handle-tutorial), I wanted to verify my personal information wasn't publicly exposed through WHOIS records.

I checked my domain's WHOIS privacy status using [Cloudflare's RDAP lookup tool](https://rdap.cloudflare.com/). After entering my domain, I confirmed my personal details (name, address, email) were not visible in the results.

While Cloudflare provides WHOIS privacy protection by default for most domains, it's worth verifying before using your domain publicly. [Cloudflare's documentation on WHOIS privacy](https://developers.cloudflare.com/registrar/account-options/whois-redaction/) has more information on how it works.
