# Notes

## Promotions vs growth

Promotions, titles and rubrics can become a goal in themselves and can steal focus from what you are building. Instead, growth can be approached as a cycle of continuous challenge and learning during the course the daily work of scaling a product.

## Measuring your performance as an engineering manager
Ask yourself: "What have I done to make the product better?" - *A question that makes you think about your impact outside of the usual metrics around team health and output.*

## Creativity vs process
For as long as your scale allows, prioritise creativity over process. In practice, this means discussing principles rather than writing detailed guidebooks. While guidebooks have their place in structured processes like incident response, they can stifle creativity in day-to-day work.
