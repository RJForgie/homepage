A pragmatic path for my colleagues who are interested in learning JavaScript/TypeScript.

## Fundamentals

[Eloquent JavaScript](https://eloquentjavascript.net/)  
Before tackling TypeScript you need to know JavaScript. If you absorb this book and complete the exercises you'll already be better equipped than most JS devs in terms of understanding the key concepts. It's one of my favourite programming books; it's free and Marijn recently updated it with the release of the fourth edition.

## TypeScript

[TypeScript is not a programming language](https://chrlschn.dev/blog/2023/09/typescript-is-not-a-programming-language/)  
A bit of background of what TypeScript is and how to reason about it. If you want to really nerd out on the background then there is even a [TypeScript Documentary](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U6s2pdxebSo).

[Beginner's TypeScript](https://www.totaltypescript.com/tutorials/beginners-typescript)  
Enough TypeScript to get you started. A lot of "advanced" TypeScript is really only useful if you writing your own framework or library so the basics will get you pretty far in application code.

## Practice

[Exercism - JavaScript](https://exercism.org/tracks/javascript)  
[Exercism - Typescript](https://exercism.org/tracks/typescript)  
Give these exercises a spin to test out what you've learned; the format is similar to many job interview problems.
