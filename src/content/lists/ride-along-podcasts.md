[Aaron Francis has given a name](https://youtu.be/hvODv57cB5A?si=0Wn8741pKScm72Bk&t=334) to my favourite genre of podcasts; the Ride Along.

Podcasts where the hosts take your along on the journey of building something. Nothing beats them for me; everything else gets old eventually.

My favourite ride along podcasts:

- [Mostly Technical](https://mostlytechnical.com/) - [Aaron Francis](https://x.com/aarondfrancis) / [Ian Landsman](https://bsky.app/profile/ianlandsman.com)
- [Art of Product](https://artofproductpodcast.com/) - [Ben Orenstein](https://x.com/r00k) / [Derrick Reimer](https://x.com/derrickreimer)
- [Hackers Incorporated](https://hackersincorporated.com/) - [Adam Wathan](https://x.com/adamwathan) / [Ben Orenstein](https://x.com/r00k)
- [Bootstrapped Web](https://bootstrappedweb.com/) - [Brian Casel](https://x.com/CasJam) / [Jordan Gal](https://x.com/JordanGal)
